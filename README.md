Client/Server Development
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.

  The best way to maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is to follow industry standard coding practices this includes readable code, in-line comments where needed, and using OOP where needed to make the code more modular and managable.  The way I approach building my CRUD file was to first determine I could correctly make a connection between the Jupyter program, my Python file, and the database.  Next, I built one method at a time and tested it as I coded. Then I expanded the methods by adding additional commands. Finally, when an application is working properly I go back and clean up the code by combining, removing, or changing it to be more readable.  I believe in iterative coding which is why I tend to work on one part of the code at a time, this can be problamatic when non-working starter code is given.

What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  The advatages of working in the way I do is that I can see issues early on instead of writing dozens of lines of code, only for the prgram to break and not be able to figure out why or have to delete a lot of work I've already done.  The CRUD Python module is very simple in nature and could be used in other databases by simply swapping out the connection commands.
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.
  As I stated in a previous question I use iterative coding and take on one task at a time.
  
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
