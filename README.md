<h3>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.</h3>

  The best way to maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is to follow industry standard coding practices this includes readable code, in-line comments where needed, and using OOP where needed to make the code more modular and managable.  The way I approach building my CRUD file was to first determine I could correctly make a connection between the Jupyter program, my Python file, and the database.  Next, I built one method at a time and tested it as I coded. Then I expanded the methods by adding additional commands. Finally, when an application is working properly I go back and clean up the code by combining, removing, or changing it to be more readable.  I believe in iterative coding which is why I tend to work on one part of the code at a time, this can be problamatic when non-working starter code is given.

<h3>What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</h3>
  
  The advatages of working in the way I do is that I can see issues early on instead of writing dozens of lines of code, only for the prgram to break and not be able to figure out why or have to delete a lot of work I've already done.  The CRUD Python module is very simple in nature and could be used in other databases by simply swapping out the connection commands.
  
<h3>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.</h3>
 
  As I stated in a previous question I use iterative coding and take on one task at a time.
  
<h3>How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</h3>
  MongoDB was new to me with this class and learning the query commands was like learning a completely new coding language, add that with not knowing DASH either it was a recipe for trouble.  Taking all this into consideration it was not surprising that I spent 4 days trying to figure out an error I was getting.  In a real world situation I normally would have been able to ask my associates of the senior dev, but when coding alone you are at the mercy of Google, so if nothing else I've gotten much better at scouring the internet for answers.  

<h3>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</h3>

Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts.  While computer programs can do many things the best of which make laborious tasks fast and easy.  For Grazioso Salvare, instead of having to hire someone to go through each and every individual animal at all the shelters to find the right animals for each rescure type, they can simply use a drop menu and have the data they require instantly and with acompanying visual data.
